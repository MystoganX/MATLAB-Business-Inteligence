%% Data Visualization: Heatmap Charts
% by Rodolfo Mu√±oz
%% 
% For this example, we're going to analyze the user's engagement in *Twitch's 
% Customer Support*, for that we'll load the dataset *twcs.csv*

clear variables; close all; clc;
[filename,path] = uigetfile('*.xls;*.xlsx;*.csv');
%% 
% Because of its size, we'll use a datastore where we'll select only the columns 
% related to the chat timestamps

tabds = datastore([path filename]);
tabds.SelectedVariableNames = {'tweet_id','created_at'};
preview(tabds)
%% 
% We define some variables to delimit our heatmaps and create labels later

months = {'Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr','May','Jun','Jul','Aug','Sep','Oct','Nov','Dec'};
days = {'Sun','Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat'};
wd = 1:7; hh = 0:1:23;
mm = 1:12; dd = 1:31;
A_dd = zeros(31,12);
A_wd = zeros(7,24);
A_mm = zeros(12,31);
%% 
% With that, we start reading the datastore block by block until all data has 
% been aggregated in variables _A_dd_, _A_wd_ and _A_mm_

while hasdata(tabds)
    tab = read(tabds);
    % Process the data to get a datetime array with all data
    dates_raw = strrep(tab.created_at," +0000","");
    dates_raw = extractBetween(dates_raw," ",length(dates_raw{1}));
    dates = datetime(dates_raw,'InputFormat','MMM dd HH:mm:ss yyyy');
    % Extract specific time-parameters
    dates_dd = day(dates);
    dates_mm = month(dates);
    dates_wd = weekday(dates);
    dates_hh = hour(dates);    
    % Accumulate temporal data using histograms
    A_dd = A_dd + hist3([dates_dd dates_hh],'Ctrs',{dd hh(1:2:end)},'CdataMode','auto');
    A_wd = A_wd + hist3([dates_wd dates_hh],'Ctrs',{wd hh},'CdataMode','auto');
    A_mm = A_mm + hist3([dates_mm dates_dd],'Ctrs',{mm dd},'CdataMode','auto');
end
%% Use of Heatmap() function
% This functions allows to create a heatmap visualization that includes a colorbar 
% very fast and easily, which only requirement is the matrix data and labels for 
% each axis are optional. 

A = A_wd;
A_min = min(A(:));
A_max = max(A(:));
heatmap(hh,days,A,"Title",'Weekly Global Engagement',"CellLabelColor","none");
%% 
% And now we change the colors to match the style of the reference heatmap of 
% Facebook Global Engagement

c_top = [32 72 77]/255;
c_mid = [87 137 224]/255;
c_bot = [255 255 255]/255;
color_map = getcolormap(A,[c_top;c_mid;c_bot],'limits',[0 max(A(:))]);
colormap(color_map);
%% 
% In Matlab 2020b, the using the _heatmap()_ function has some cons. Although 
% its easy to use, the heatmap chart is a standalone object and some of its elements 
% cannot be modified, specially the colorbar. Because of that we'll use the function 
% _imagesc()_ for all the visualizations, as it allows us to modify all elements 
% easily like when we use a _plot()_ function. 
%% Weekly Global Engagement
% The function _imagesc()_ lets us draw a colored matrix similar to the heatmap, 
% but all other aspects such as axis and labels must be customized manually. So 
% we start by plotting a _imagesc()_ to see the user's engagement in the twitter's 
% support chat over the week.

A = A_wd; 
A_min = min(A(:));
A_max = max(A(:));
imagesc(hh,wd,A);
title('Weekly Global Engagement')
%% 
% And now we place the _xticks_ and _yticks_ half a unit to the side, so the 
% grid divides the image into equally spaced blocks which correspond to the ones 
% painted by _imagesc()_. 

x_Ticks = hh-0.5;
xTickLabels = cellstr(num2str(hh'));
yTicks = wd-0.5;
xticks(x_Ticks);
yticks(yTicks);
grid on;
ax = gca;
ax.GridColor = [1 1 1];
%% 
% Given the tick positions, the _xticklabels_ and _yticklabels_ would be placed 
% awkwardly at the start of each block if we used them and that would make reading 
% confusing. To solve that, we'll have to place the labels manually by writting 
% them with the _text()_ at the correct locations. 

ax.XAxis.Visible = "off";
ax.YAxis.Visible = "off";
for k = 1:length(x_Ticks)
    txt = text(x_Ticks(k)+0.5,yTicks(end)+1.1,xTickLabels{k},'HorizontalAlignment','center');
end
for k = 1:length(days)
    txt = text(x_Ticks(1)-0.2,yTicks(k)+0.5,days{k},'HorizontalAlignment','right');
end
%% 
% And finally we setup the _colormap_ and _colorbar_ so it shows qualitative 
% labels and save the figure.

color_map = getcolormap(A,[c_top;c_mid;c_bot],'limits',[0 max(A(:))],'mode','3level');
colormap(color_map);
cb = colorbar;
cb.Location = "southoutside";
cb.Ticks = [A_min (A_max+A_min)/2 A_max];
cb.TickLabels = {'Lowest','Average','Highest'};
cb.FontWeight = "bold";

% With that, we can see that the busiest hours are during the evening in working 
% days, specially between 14:00 and 21:00. Also that most of the morning hours 
% have little movement, which is closely related to sleeping hours. 
% 
% If we assume that the behaviour of people using the support chat is closely 
% related to their use of twitter and their daily routine, two interesting aspects 
% of daily life can be confirmed by looking at this graph: 
%% 
% # People getting up later on weekends, by extending very low engagement time 
% periods close to mid-day. 
% # People getting more bored at work over the week, by increasing Twitter's 
% usage as Friday closes by.
%% Yearly Global Engagement
% Similar to the previous heatmap, with the difference that this ones displays 
% engagement in a sort of calendar where each day of the year is presented as 
% a cell. Given that most data from the file tscs.csv is concentrated between 
% October and December, we change the _GridColor_ to a dark one so the whole heatmap 
% is visible.

A = A_mm; 
A_min = min(A(:));
A_max = max(A(:));
imagesc(dd,mm,A);

x_Ticks = dd(1:end)-0.5;
x_TickLabels = cellstr(num2str(dd'));
y_Ticks = mm-0.5;
xticks(x_Ticks);
yticks(y_Ticks);
grid on;
ax = gca;
ax.GridColor = [0 0 0];

ax.XAxis.Visible = "off";
ax.YAxis.Visible = "off";
axis([0 32 0 13])
for k = 1:2:length(x_Ticks)
    txt = text(x_Ticks(k)+0.5,y_Ticks(end)+1.6,x_TickLabels{k},'HorizontalAlignment','center');
end
for k = 1:length(months)
    txt = text(x_Ticks(1)-0.2,y_Ticks(k)+0.5,months{k},'HorizontalAlignment','right');

% To vary a little, we also set the colormap to *'5level'* mode so we get a 
% discrete distribution of only 5 colors instead of the usual gradient.
